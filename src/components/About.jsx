      <p>

      With over a decade of experience in sales and marketing, I'm transitioning my career to become a full stack web developer. Throughout my career, I've consistently driven revenue growth, improved customer loyalty, and elevated brand awareness through data-driven strategies.



I'm now applying my analytical mindset and creative problem-solving skills to web development, focusing on technologies such as JavaScript, React, Node.js, and database management. My goal is to leverage my business acumen and newly acquired technical skills to create innovative, user-centric web solutions.

Fluent in Spanish and English, I bring a unique blend of communication skills, technical aptitude, and business insight to my new role as a full stack developer.
